# Parents-Guide-Control
Parents Guide Control File Format

This Idea is about creating new file standard, which could be adopted by video/audio players.
This File contains parent guided information about the video/audio you are playing.

## Common Questions:
### What does it do ?

Letâ€™s say you are watching a movie in your device
This file will contains description about scenes parent guide. Like:

- Age restriction           : +18, +12 , .. etc.
- Category                      : Violence, Gore, Nudity, Profanity, etc.
- ~~Suggested behavior : Blur, Skip, Mute, .. etc.~~


### Why do I need it ?

Examples :

- You are watching movie with kids, and you want to skip uncomfortable senses, 
- You like the movie but you do want to see gore/violence senses.
- Content provider provide one movie, with this file format, instead of shipping multiple version of the movies. (uncut or family versions).

### How to use it?

As simple as setting subtitle for the movie.

Example:

- Open Movie with VLC 
- Select Parent Guided file
- Specify in the option (Age restriction, Avoid scenes types)
- Play the move, and all unwanted scenes will be avoided while playing.

### How these files are created ?

These files will be created with multiple ways:

- Contribution from people, by creating these files for movies they watched. (Like what has be done with subtitle for years)



### What we are going to do next ?

- We will try to create simple POC, to show the Idea in real world example.
- Building utility to generate parent guided files. (this way we can start contributing to community)
- More diagnosis and research to build file format specification, which will allow future expansion, and simple adoption by video/audio players.
- Reach community such as VLC to adopt this feature, and do contribute there to implement it.


### Expectations:

- We hope that we could build community for such feature, which is very helpful for most of us (let me know your Idea).
- This will become a standard in most video/audio players.
